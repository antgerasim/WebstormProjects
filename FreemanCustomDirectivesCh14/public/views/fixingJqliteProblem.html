        <p>I append an ol element as a child of the element argument passed to the link function, which represents the
            div
            element. The problem is signaled in the name I use in the variable to which I assign the result of the
            append operation:
            listElem. In fact, the append method—like all the methods that take element arguments in Table 15-5—returns
            a
            jqLite object representing the elements on which the operation was performed, which is, in this example, the
            div
            element and not the ol element. That means the other jqLite statement in the example has an unexpected
            effect:</p>

        <p>
            listElem.append(&quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot;).append(&quot;&lt;span&gt;&quot;).text(scope.names[i]);
        </p>

        <p>
            There are three operations in this statement—two calls to the append method and a call to the text method—
            and all of these operations are being applied to the div element. First, I add a new li element as a child
            of the div
            element; then, I add a span element. Finally, I call the text method, which has the effect of replacing all
            the child
            elements I added to the div with a text string, and since I am performing these operations in a for loop, I
            repeat them
            for each value in the array. This is why the div element ends up containing Oranges; it is the last value in
            the array.
            This is an incredibly common mistake to make, even for developers experienced in jQuery. I do it all the
            time,
            including when I sketched out the custom directive that I started the chapter with. You must keep an eye on
            which set
            of elements you are performing operations on—something that jqLite makes harder than jQuery by omitting some
            methods that are helpful in keeping track of what’s going on.
            I find that the most reliable way of avoiding this problem is to use the angular.element method to create
            jqLite
            objects and perform operations on them in separate statements. You can see how I have done this in Listing
            15-18, in
            which I demonstrate how to properly generate the list elements.
