/*The service method takes two arguments: the name of the service and a factory function that is called to create
 the service object. When AngularJS calls the factory function, it assigns a new object that is accessible via the this
 keyword, and I use this object to define today and tomorrow properties. This is a simple service, but it means I can
 access the today and tomorrow values via my service anywhere in my AngularJS codeâ€”something that helps simplify
 the development process when creating more complex applications.
