        Instead of defining dataValue as a property directly on the scope of the parent controller,
        I have defined it as a
        property of an object called data. The other changes in this file update the reference to the dataValue property
        to
        access it via the data object. In Listing 13-12, you can see how I have reflected this change in the ng-model
        directives
        that link the input elements with the dataValue property in the controllers.html file.

        How does it works?
        When you read the value of a property that is defined directly on the scope, AngularJS checks to see whether
        there is a local property in the controller’s scope and, if not, starts working its way up the scope hierarchy to see
        whether it has inherited one. However, when you use the ng-model directive to modify such a property, AngularJS
        checks to see whether the scope has a property of the right name and, if not, assumes you want to implicitly define it.
        The effect is to override the property value, much as I did with the behavior in the previous section. The reason that
        editing the contents of a child input element prevents the Reverse button from working is that there are now two
        dataValue properties—one defined by the top-level controller and one by the child you edited. The reverseText
        behavior is defined by the top-level controller, and it operates on the dataValue defined in the top-level scope, leaving
        the child’s dataValue property unaltered.
        This doesn’t happen when you assign an object to the scope and then define your data properties on that object.
        This is because JavaScript implements what is known as prototype inheritance—a topic so dry and confusing that
        I am not going to attempt to explain it here, although I describe the basics in Chapter 18. What is important is the
        knowledge that defining properties directly on the scope like this:
        ...
        $scope.dataValue = "Hello, Adam";
        ...
        means that using the ng-model directive will create local variables, while using an object as an intermediary,
        like this:
        ...
        $scope.data = {
        dataValue: "Hello, Adam"
        }
        ...
        ensures that ng-model will update the data values defined in the parent scope. This is not a bug. It is a deliberate feature
        that allows you to decide how your controller and its scope will work, and you can mix and match both techniques in the
        same scope. If you want a value that is initially shared but will be copied when modified, then define your data properties
        directly on the scope. To ensure that there is only one value, then define your data properties via an object.
