/*
The ZipCodes service declares a dependency on the $rootScope service and uses it within the setZipCode
method to call the $broadcast event. The controllers declare a dependency on the ZipCodes service and call the
setZipCode method rather than operate directly on $rootScope. There is no change in the functionalityâ€”this
convention is about reducing duplication by putting code that is likely to be required by different controllers in a
single location.*/
